Its not reckommended to use default persistence settings in Prod environment

Always commentout SAVE conf in config file & use BGSAVE.
BGSAVE cann't be configured in conf file, so needs to setup a CRON to run BGSAVE periodically.

Difference between SAVE & BGSAVE.

  ==> SAVE blocks while BGSAVE doesn't
  ==> SAVE can be configured in redis.config, BGSAVE can't be configured.
